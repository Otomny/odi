# Otomny Dependency Injection

ODI is a lightweight Dependency Injection framework for Flow.
It helps you write cleaner code with Component, Autowiring, and more.

**It should not be used outside of the Flow framework**

**For spigot developers, please refer to Flow documentation**

*(as there is no documentation for that part)*
